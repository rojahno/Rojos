### A react component library. 
This repository is a hobby project where I have created some commonly used react components. The goal of the project was to learn more about React and to create reusable components that I could use for the future.

The repository has components for:
- Layout
- Loaders
- Data Display
- And other miscellaneous components souch as Snake and a DVD screensaver.
